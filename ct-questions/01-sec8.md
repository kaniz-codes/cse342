## Question 1

Imagine a `ResearchInstitute` class that models resource allocation for advanced laboratories. It has three key attributes:

- `number_of_scientists (int)` – how many lead scientists are hired.  
- `number_of_assistants (int)` – how many technical assistants support them.  
- `grant_budget (double)` – how much external funding is allocated.  
- `Number_of_Institutes (static int)`

Define three constructors in the `ResearchInstitute` class and a static function `InstituteNumber`.

In the `main` function:
- Create different `ResearchInstitute` objects (one using each constructor).
- Print the total number of institute objects created.

```java
class ResearchInstitute{
    int num_of_scientists;
    int num_of_assistants;
    double grant_budget;
    static int num_of_Institutes = 0;

    ResearchInstitute(){
        num_of_scientists = 1;
        num_of_assistants = 10;
        grant_budget = 1000;
        num_of_Institutes++;
    }
    ResearchInstitute(int num_of_scientists, int num_of_assistants){
        this.num_of_scientists = num_of_scientists;
        this.num_of_assistants = num_of_assistants;
        grant_budget = 40000;
        num_of_Institutes++;
    }

    ResearchInstitute(int num_of_scientists, int num_of_assistants,  double grant_budget){
        this.num_of_scientists = num_of_scientists;
        this.num_of_assistants = num_of_assistants;
        this.grant_budget = grant_budget;
        num_of_Institutes++;
    }

  public static void totalResearchInstitute(){
        System.out.println("Total ResearchInstitute objects "+num_of_Institutes);
    }
}
public class task {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ResearchInstitute r = new ResearchInstitute();
        ResearchInstitute r1 = new ResearchInstitute(10,10);
        ResearchInstitute r2 = new ResearchInstitute(7,9, 6.88);

        ResearchInstitute.totalResearchInstitute();
    }
}
```
